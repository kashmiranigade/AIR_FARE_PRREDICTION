Introduction
This notebook is designed to predict airfares based on historical data. The dataset contains features like airline, date of journey, source, destination, route, departure and arrival times, duration, and the total number of stops. Several regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, are used to train the prediction model.

Dependencies
To run this notebook, you need the following Python libraries:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
You can install the required libraries using the following command:

sh
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Data Description
The dataset used in this notebook contains the following columns:

Airline: The airline company
Date_of_Journey: The date of the journey
Source: The source airport
Destination: The destination airport
Route: The route taken by the flight
Dep_Time: Departure time
Arrival_Time: Arrival time
Duration: Duration of the flight
Total_Stops: Total number of stops between source and destination
Price: The price of the ticket (target variable)
Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include:

Handling missing values
Converting date columns to datetime objects
Extracting useful features from the date columns (e.g., day, month, year)
Converting categorical variables into numerical ones using techniques like one-hot encoding and label encoding
Feature Engineering
Feature engineering involves:

Extracting additional features from existing columns, such as extracting hours and minutes from the Duration column.
Creating new features that might help improve the model's performance.
Model Training and Evaluation
Several regression models are trained and evaluated, including:

Linear Regression
Decision Tree Regression
Random Forest Regression
Model evaluation metrics include:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R-squared score (RÂ²)
Results
The results of each model are compared based on the evaluation metrics. Visualizations are created to show the performance of the models and the importance of various features.
